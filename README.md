"# RNA-Seq-Analysis-using-R" 

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis is a powerful technique for investigating gene expression and transcriptome dynamics. Recently, I performed RNA-seq analysis using the R programming language, and I want to acknowledge the Computational Biology Research Group (CBRG) for providing the necessary data. The libraries used in this analysis included rWSBIM2122 ,DESeq2, tidyverse, biomaRt, org.Hs.eg.db, clusterProfiler, enrichplot, and plotly.
